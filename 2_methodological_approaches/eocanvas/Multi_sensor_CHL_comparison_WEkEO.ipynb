    "Whilst production by algae is an essential component of marine foodwebs and biogeochemical cycling, extreme blooms [[1]](#ref1) can also pose risks to environmental and human health. Eutrophication, excessive algal growth, as a result of excess nutrients from anthropogenic activities, is a long standing issue in the Baltic sea. Cyanobacteria play a central role in this issue. Whilst cyanobacteria blooms can occur naturally, particularly in warm weather, they can be exacerbated by nutrient inputs. They also play a feedback role in the nutrient loading due to their nitrogen fixing capabilities, and present additional hazards when they bloom. Blooms can affect fish stocks, aquaculture, bathing water quality and tourism, as well as causing rashes, respiratory, and gastrointestinal issues for those exposed.\n",

    "Satellite ocean colour can provide operational views of water quality, with the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) sensor aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission, operated by EUMETSAT, particularly well suited to observing eutrophication and algal blooms such as those occurring in the Baltic Sea. However retreiving accurate geophysical information in these situations is not trivial, and products such a chlorophyll-a derived from a variety of algorithms, can be more/less suitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take a variety of different approaches to exploring some Baltic cyanobacterial blooms, taking data from multiple sources. Single sensor approaches will use level-1b and level-2 OLCI ocean colour products, distributed by EUMETSAT and made available by on the <a href='https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/'>WEkEO</a> DIAS cloud platform. These data are distributed on the instrument grid, which changes in time, meaning that we will have to process each image in turn to eventually work with them all concert. We will use the WEkEO `eocanvas` serverless function capability to remotely call the ESA SNAP package to perform this processing. We will compare these products with the multi-sensor, level-3 Baltic chlorophyll product provided by the <a href=\"https://marine.copernicus.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Copernicus Marine Service</a>. More specifically, we will look at the chlorophyll estimates retrieved using the following algorithms;\n",

Modern sensors such as the OLCI sensors aboard the Sentinel-3 satellites can be exploted, thanks to their unique spectral bands, to develop specific algorithms for detection of blooms. Longer time series of ocean colour data are being developed to support the assessment of the role of blooms in eutrophication trends in regions such as the Baltic sea. As the time series of OLCI data lengthens, and new opportunities from hyperspectral missions are realised, further opportunities will arise to expand this work."

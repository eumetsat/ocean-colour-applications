    "\n",
    "When we want to monitor any environmental phenomena, one of the key things we must consider is how many measurements we need to make, and how often we need to make them. Satellites offer many advantages for environmental monitoring. Measurements can be made very often (usually in the order of multiple times per day to multiple times per week or month), and at increasingly high resolution and coverage (from 10's m in focused areas, through to 100's of m's and km scale globally). Because of instrument and satellite platform engineering, orbital requirements, data transfer, and physical limitations of measurement methods, there are nearly always compromises to be made in the spatial, temporal, and spectral/other resolutions and sensitivities in mission design. Thus, to optimise our monitoring approaches, we often need to use multiple data sources (different satellite, in situ or model datasets). \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges of managing coastal and inland water quality as discussed in [the previous notebook](4G_CoastalWaterQuality_Classification.ipynb), are an example where the use of multiple data sources, can bring substantial benefits. However, combining data sources can be very difficult - the way that instruments measure, their sensitivities, and resolutions, have to be accounted for to create datasets that can be interpreted appropriately by decision makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow in this notebook uses [mixture density networks with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/MixtureSameFamily). `Mixture density networks` (MDN) are a class of neural networks where the outputs of the network(s) are used in the parameterisation of Gaussians, giving a probability distribution over the target variable. This is particularly useful where you have non-unique inverse problems (such as is the case with ocean colour).\n",

To give us the best possible ocean picture of their nature and variability from Earth Observation, we need to take advantage of the capability of multiple sensors. Machine learning approaches, such as `mixture density networks`, show great promise in helping us to combine data from these disparate sources, and so help us to better understand and monitor the processes that govern the highly dynamic regions near our shore, where most of us engage with the ocean.\n",
